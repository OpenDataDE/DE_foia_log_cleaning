Elaine Manlove, D.O.E.Re: Your Letter of 4/24/18    Possibly I am not clear and again request that each FOIA filing have a copy of it returned, in that way I/we can know what specific FOIA you are referring to, and in that way we can resolve matters quicker when we know what one you are having issues with, for as you know we have several FOIA’s out, and this filing for new records (see*) is pursuant to 29 DE C CH 100.    Also, due to delays and you can confirm if necessary, I ask that you do not use the UNIT designation, for the fact is that address is an old one, and it delays delivery, each filing I submit has the correct UNIT at time of that mailing, but it is very “fluid”, and I don’t know when, where, UNIT changes occur. Also only one designation of the # 451255 is needed.    New records requested are ANY filings by Dennis Williams, AS a State of DE Representative (there are 2 of such names, I/we need the Dennis Williams, who was a Representative, & then ran for & became City of Wilmington Mayor, those records are also requested, if held by your department.

I prefer all information to be scanned and emailed rather than copied and mailed to save time and expense. However, if CD-ROM or paper copies are the only option, that is fine. Below is a statement from FBI Director Comey's testimony on March 20, 2017 that mentions one example of correspondence I am requesting.COMEY: Well, among other things, we alerted people who had been victims of intrusions to permit them to tighten their systems to see if they couldn't kick the Russian actors out. We also, as a government, supplied information to all the states so they could equip themselves to make sure there was no successful effort to affect the vote and there was none, as we said earlier. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.84837084a6b9 In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a representative of the news media affiliated with The Wall Street Journal  and this request is made as part of news gathering and not for a commercial use. I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. For example, former Secretary of State Jeh Johnson testified on June 21, 2017, that it is in the public interest to know about the cybersecurity of election systems and hacking attempts by various actors including the Russian government: “We recognized we had an overriding responsibility to inform the public that a powerful foreign state actor had covertly intervened in our democracy,” Johnson said. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/read-jeh-johnsons-prepared-testimony-russia/ However, if a fee waiver is not granted, please do not void my request as I still want to receive copies of the records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I can be reached at 410-294-6819. If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. Please contact me by email at alexa.corse@wsj.com and “cc” byron.tau@wsj.com if you have any questions or wish to reach me, instead of mail, in the interests of speed.

I would prefer electronic copies of purchase orders and quotes, but another document (like a spreadsheet) is perfectly acceptable if it includes the information contained on purchase orders including: purchase order number, product, mfg./sku. number, unit price, total price, vendor, and date. I am specifically looking for software products, but if it’s easier to include all products that’s fine.I do not want to be overly burdensome on you or your agency, so if this request will be difficult to fulfill or there’s a way to make it easier for you (such as redefining the terms to look at purchases from a specific vendor or commodity class), please feel free to contact me and we can find a way to work it out. If you are not responsible for FOIA requests, I apologize for the confusion. If you could please let me know where to direct this, I would really appreciate it.If there will be fees for this request, please inform me of the cost and get my authorization before proceeding.  However, I would like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will significantly contribute to the public’s understanding of Delaware's software purchases.  I would respectfully request a response in writing, within the timeframe described by law, if you intend to deny this request.  If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. Also, if you expect a significant delay in fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about the prospective timeline.
